# React 19 – State Practice (Vite)

A tiny app to practice `useState`, isolated/independent component state, and lifted/shared state.

## Quickstart

1. Ensure you have a recent Node.js (>=18) and npm installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Your browser will open to the app. Edit `src/App.jsx` and save to see hot updates.

## What to Explore

- Add more state variables (e.g., a `likes` counter).
- Create a third `Gallery` to verify state isolation.
- Lift state up to a parent and pass it down as props to keep components in sync.
